## Introduction

The REFED is the first emotional brain-computer interface dataset integrating multimodal brain signals and real-time dynamic emotion annotation, fills a critical gap in the study of neural mechanisms of emotional dynamic evolution and the development of high-reliability aBCI models. By synchronizing the acquisition of EEG and fNIRS signals, REFED realizes the joint observation of neuroelectrical activity and hemodynamic response under emotional evocation, which provides unique data support for exploring emotion-related neuro-vascular coupling mechanisms. Meanwhile, the dynamic potency and arousal annotation based on subjects' subjective reports, for the first time, realizes millisecond-level temporal alignment of brain signals with emotional state changes, which significantly improves the temporal modeling capability of the emotion recognition model. Experimental validation shows that the dataset meets the standard in terms of emotion evoked validity and labeling reliability, and the multimodal signal features show significant correlation with the dynamic labeling. The open sharing of REFED will promote the cross-modal neural representation parsing for the dynamic encoding of emotions in the following research directions, and lay an important foundation for the field of affective computation and brain-computer interfaces to move towards dynamic interaction paradigms with higher ecological validity.

In order to realize the real-time annotation of subjects' emotional state and the automated control of the whole process, we also developed a real-time annotation and control system, as shown in the following figure.
